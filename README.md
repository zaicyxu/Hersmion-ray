ML learining note
This note is based on my comprehensive learning summary from teacher Li Muâ€™s video open class when I was studying at NTU business school. It includes a document that provides a general introduction to machine learning, which can help beginners get a preliminary understanding of machine learning, as well as some very simple machine learning model source codes that can be easily reproduced in your computer environment.
